## room2.fm

This is my refactoring of the room2 code base to set it up for continued use

## To Do

# Modal
- Modal for Mobile ~ Decided to wait until later to make sure mobile layout is consistant - perhaps the modal continue button will need to match the prompt response button in some way ~
- Modal button styling - animation and different cursor?

# ~~Text Chat~~

# Marquee Banner
- CD Gif border style?
- Banner border?

# Emoji Triangle
- Is this useful still good design? Does anyone actually get something out of using it - especially if the time scale changes

# Lissajous Display

# Sound Controls

# Drawing Input

# Colour Selection
