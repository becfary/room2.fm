# room2.fm

This is my refactoring of the room2 code base to set it up for continued use

# Credits
 - Curtis Jurgensen's custom cursor codepen was really helpful - https://codepen.io/curtisj44/pen/yGxJNX
 - Matthew Jones for his article on state management for undo/redo with fabric = https://exceptionnotfound.net/drawing-with-fabricjs-and-typescript-part-7-undo-redo/

# To Do
- Do I need pixi-react-fiber? Uninstall if not
- Update pre-load - how much do I need?
- Replace Artist Presets object with data from server
- Add onmousehold style for buttons

## Modal
- Modal for Mobile ~ Decided to wait until later to make sure mobile layout is consistant - perhaps the modal continue button will need to match the prompt response button in some way ~
- Modal button styling - animation and different cursor?

## ~~Text Chat~~

## Marquee Banner
