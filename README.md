## room2.fm

This is my refactoring of the room2 code base to set it up for continued use

## Credits
 - Curtis Jurgensen's custom cursor codepen was really helpful - https://codepen.io/curtisj44/pen/yGxJNX

## To Do
- Do I need pixi-react-fiber? Uninstall if not
- Update pre-load - how much do I need?
- Replace Artist Presets object with data from server

# Modal
- Modal for Mobile ~ Decided to wait until later to make sure mobile layout is consistant - perhaps the modal continue button will need to match the prompt response button in some way ~
- Modal button styling - animation and different cursor?

# ~~Text Chat~~

# Marquee Banner
- CD Gif border style?
- Banner border?
- Responsive text size

# Emoji Triangle
- Is this useful still good design? Does anyone actually get something out of using it - especially if the time scale changes
- Is equilateral the right answer?
- Colour Ballance of the Y-Axis Gradient

# Lissajous Display

# Sound Controls
- Add some animations to the volume notch controls
- Handle click and hold events ?

# Drawing Input
- Look into undo and erase functions with fabric js

# Colour Selection
- Finish Styling UI

# Text Input

# Intro Overlay

# Options Menu
