  This website was created and is maintained on the unceded territory of the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin Nations, 
  the Traditional Custodians of the land. We recognise their ongoing legacy of connection to land, waters and culture 
  and pay respect to their Elders past, present and emerging. We extend this respect to those of the wider Kulin Nations 
  along with all other First Nations peoples of this continent, whose stolen land the material pathways that allow our 
  digital connectivity are built upon.

    There is no right or wrong way for you to listen, respond to, or feel a piece of music or sound. We encourage you to 
    trust your ears and intuition and respond sincerely and in whatever way feels true to your experience.

    You are encouraged to use the emoji triangle in the bottom left of the screen to convey what you are feeling about the 
    sounds you are receiving. Click and drag the circle to any of the points of the triangle or somewhere between them. The 
    collective selection of everyone participating in the stream will be reflected in the main visuals.

    Periodically, prompts will come up in the lower middle of the screen. Some of these will request a written response, 
    some a drawn response. You can write or draw your response in the white box at the bottom of the screen before clicking 
    the ‘submit response’ button to share it with others. Your responses to these prompts will be completely anonymised and 
    not attributable to you in any way. Above the ‘submit response’ button, you can select the colour palette you will be 
    able to draw responses with.

    You can use the chat box on the right of the screen to directly speak to others participating. Select a username and 
    click ‘Join Room’ to engage. Be yourself, be someone else, be whomever you want to be!
